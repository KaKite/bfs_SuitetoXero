To create your Xero app login to your Xero account, then open a new browser window and go to the following URL:

https://developer.xero.com/myapps

Follow the simple instructions to create your new app and save the App name, redirect URI, client ID and client secret values for entry into your SuiteCRM installation

Install the module in SuiteCRM

Installation of this module is accomplished via the SuiteCRM Module Loader menu option. After installation a Xero Configuration entry must be created based on the values that are generated when you created your Xero App.

After validating your module license and creating your Xero Configuration Settings go to the Actions menu and click on the Connect to Xero link. If this action is successful you can now begin using the installation. The installation will NOT work if this step is NOT taken. After successfully validating to Xero, go to the Admin -> Repair option in SuiteCRM and run a QRR. After completing this step, scroll to the bottom of the screen and execute ANY SQL that is visible there. Your Suite to Xero module is now ready for use.

If there is a problem please get back to me using the email contact above OR post a query on the SuiteCRM Store site. I will respond ASAP.

If you have any problems with the installation, and/or thoughts on improving the functionality of the Xero Configuration module and it's associated add-ons, please don't hesitate to contact us
